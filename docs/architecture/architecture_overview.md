# **System Architecture Overview**
## **Architectural Style**
  Layered architecture
  
## **Architectural Options Condidered**
  - **Monolithic**:Tight coupling between modules
  - **Microservice**: Network latency between modules
    
## **Trade-Offs**
 - We chose Layered Architecture due to its simplicity, maintainability, scalability and testing
   
## **Potential Risks & Issues**
   -Peformance bottleneck
   -Layer bypassing
   -Limited scalability
   -Tight coupling between layers
   
## **Layers**
-Presentation Layer:Handles user input and displays information
-Application Layer:Business Logic layer
-Data Layer:Manages how information is stored  

## **Justification**
 - Using these layers is Seperation of Concerns
 - Easier to maintain, manage and test
 -Suitable for the team's technology stack
